Coastal Destruction Analysis Using Machine Learning

The allure of coastal living has drawn people to settle where land meets sea for centuries, offering rich resources and opportunities. Today, this trend continues, with nearly 75% of the global population residing within 50 kilometers of the ocean. However, this proximity to the coast exposes communities, especially those in developing countries and small island states, to heightened climate risks that compound existing vulnerabilities.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that adaptation costs for these nations, particularly susceptible to tropical cyclones and rising seas, could soar to as much as 20% of their gross domestic product (GDP). Tropical cyclones, with their immense destructive potential, have caused the most damage among all-weather disasters between 1980 and 2021, totaling over $1.1 trillion, with an average cost of $20.5 billion per event. In the past decade alone, economic losses from tropical cyclones exceeded 573.2 billion U.S. dollars globally, with the highest number of deaths recorded.

Against this backdrop, our project takes center stage, aiming to address the pressing need for innovative solutions in coastal resilience and climate change adaptation. Leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning, we seek to develop a model capable of automatically analyzing such imagery to detect and classify damaged and undamaged infrastructure following natural disasters. This endeavor underscores our commitment to mitigating the impact of natural disasters on coastal communities and building resilience for a sustainable future.
